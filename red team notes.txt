exploits such as OWASP top 25 or search for exploits with searchsploit or search in metasploit. Use https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-ftp for attacking other ports.

clear logs, curropt logs, or frame a user.

The event logs can be cleared with the following utility commands:
Wevtutil cl system
Wevtutil cl application
Wevtutil cl security

Phishing:
Use social engineering toolkit. 
Use malware.
Use ip loggers.
Use cred harvesters.
Use web browser exploit.

Binaries:
due to microsoft disabling macros, use .lnk files. Or put a macro file in an iso file. Also changing an executable (exe) to a screensaver (scr) doesn't do anything but make it look more legit and possibly become ignored by bad anti viruses.
