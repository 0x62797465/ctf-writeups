# notes
My own cool awesome notes I made (when I was 12, to be clear I did not upload these when I was 12)

Half of this is sleep deprived ranting don't read this if you value your time.

Update: None of this was made for public release, I put this on github in order to prevent them from being wiped by accident (my computer often got wiped in the past, this is because I'm not careful, this is no longer the case). I will now be releasing some crackme/malware analysises on here!
