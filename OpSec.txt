Rotate your ip. If this is hard to do, only do it when changing activiy, like exploiting = ip1, scanning//enum//info gathering = ip2, phishing = ip3
Spoof your headers.
threat analysis aims to answer the following questions:

    Who is the adversary is?
    What are the adversaryâ€™s goals?
    What tactics, techniques, and procedures does the adversary use?
    What critical information has the adversary obtained, if any?
Don't let them answer any.

If possible, phish using multiple domains, this would make it harder for the blue team to find IOCs.

You can break opsec rules if you know the target has limited reacourses/bad firewalls/they're stupid.

Use a normal hostname, KaliLinux, yeah that would be detected by the blue team kinda easily. 

Don't be unique. Don't use unique user agents and hostnames, or any unique trafic. Nmap tip: --script-args http.useragent="CUSTOM_AGENT"
