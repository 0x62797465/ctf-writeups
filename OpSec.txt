Rotate your ip. If this is hard to do, only do it when changing activiy, like exploiting = ip1, scanning//enum//info gathering = ip2, phishing = ip3
Spoof your headers.
threat analysis aims to answer the following questions:

    Who is the adversary is?
    What are the adversary’s goals?
    What tactics, techniques, and procedures does the adversary use?
    What critical information has the adversary obtained, if any?
Don't let them answer any.

If possible, phish using multiple domains, this would make it harder for the blue team to find IOCs.

Don't let one person in your team publicly tag, contact, ping, any public social media shit, someone. This can lead to the blue team linking up all the team members.

You can break opsec rules if you know the target has limited reacourses/bad firewalls/they're kinda fucking stupid.

Use a normal hostname, KaliLinux, yeah that would be detected by the blue team kinda easily. 

Don't be unique, your parents don't love you and your stupid as fuck. I'm joking, but don't use unique user agents and hostnames, or any unique trafic. Nmap tip: --script-args http.useragent="CUSTOM_AGENT"
